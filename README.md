## Immuva Proof v1.0.0

Immuva Proof v1.0.0 is a **frozen, audit-ready cryptographic protocol**
for verifiable AI agent actions.

Verification is:
- deterministic
- offline-capable
- independent of any trusted third party

Once a proof is generated, it can be verified forever.

This version is **normatively frozen**.
All future versions MUST remain backward-compatible.
